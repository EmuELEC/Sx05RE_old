#
# This file is not meant to be user-editable, although is kept as a separate ini
# file instead of compiled into the code for debugging purposes.
#
# The uses cases are strict:
#   * Enable fixes for things we can't reasonably emulate without completely ruining
#     performance for other games, such as the screen copies in Dangan Ronpa
#   * Disabling accuracy features like 16-bit depth rounding, when we can't seem to
#     implement them at all in a 100% compatible way
#   * Emergency game-specific compatibility fixes before releases, such as the GTA
#     music problem where every attempted fix has reduced compatibility with other games
#   * Enable "unsafe" performance optimizations that some games can tolerate and
#     others cannot. We do not currently have any of those.
#
# This functionality should NOT be used for any of the following:
#   * Cheats
#   * Fun hacks, like enlarged heads or whatever
#   * Fixing general compatibility issues. First try to find a general solution. Try hard.
